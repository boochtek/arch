People with disabilities are the largest minority in the country.
Living with disabilities spans race, ethnicity, religion, social class
and age.  The general public, conservatives and liberals alike,
supports the goals of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act,
passed in 1990.

When you consider accessibility in your design, work environment and
attitude, the effects are far reaching, not only for those with
disabilities but their relatives, friends and neighbors as
well.  Accessible or Universal Design goes well beyond compliance with
the law and promotes inclusion of all people.

If consideration is given to these smart, simple design practices
early in the design phase, the cost is minimal, if there is any
additional cost at all.  However, once construction starts, changes
may lead to higher costs, so advance planning is essential.
