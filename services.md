Accessibility Surveys
---------------------

Orientation Tour

: A brief roll or walk-through to point out obvious
  barriers to a program or service with a representative of the facility
  followed by a brief written summary. This survey utilizes an Existing
  Facilities Checklist. This tour would not be considered a survey, but
  could be used to initially determine if there are issues with a site,
  or as a preliminary step to a Basic, Full, or Customized Survey.

Basic Survey

: Typically a more thorough survey utilizing a checklist
  specific to the facility type. This survey includes a Summary and
  Report, including pictures.

Customized Survey

: This survey is designed to meet the specific needs
  of a specific customer. Corporations or developers would benefit by
  having a custom survey tool or checklist of accessibility requirements
  specific to that type of facility or site.

Wayfinding & Accessible Signage Consultation
--------------------------------------------

* Signage / Graphics Packages Reviewed
* Facility Signage Assessment & Report

Wayfinding is often one of the most frequently overlooked features of
accessibility.  Signage is a large part of wayfinding; it must be
clear, concise and consistent using specific characteristics for
contrast and lettering.  Where and how signage is implemented can
affect maximum accessibility and general usability. We do on-site
assessments and/or plan reviews to help determine where signage is
appropriate, and what other types of wayfinding methods may be more
practical. Owners purchasing graphics packages would do well to
consider the accessibility of the design to avoid wasting money, and
being out of compliance with regulations.

Product Review
--------------

All public accommodations (any private entity that serves the public)
are required to be compliant with the federal, state and local
building code and accessibility standards that generally meet the
"average" needs of most people with disabilities.

Home modifications are different, and should be specific to meet the
needs of the individual for whom the home is being modified. It is
extremely important to understand the capabilities of the individual
in order to ensure the modifications work for them now and in the
foreseeable future.  Working in coordination with the individuals'
physical or occupational therapists is most beneficial.

Prior to giving recommendations for modifications to a customer's
home, a thorough inspection of the home includes assessing the
exterior access from parking and the sidewalk, entry points, paths
through the home and individual access to rooms. This assessment
should be made with the customer to better understand the daily
schedule and typical activities in the area about to be changed to
ensure that the functional characteristics of the rooms remain.  The
consumer's needs and personal choices are essential to the layout of
any home modification.
